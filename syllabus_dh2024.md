## Course Description

This hybrid 4xx/5xx course will offer a workshop setting to advance practical and theoretical approaches to Digital History. Digital History is an approach to examining and representing the past that makes extensive use of computational technologies for research, analysis, interpretation, composition, and communication. All history projects are now digital, although some more than others, and some taking a more self-critical and self-aware approach. Students will be introduced to the ways in which digital technologies have altered, and are altering, the historical profession, while also showing the value of taking a critical approach to digital methods. Students will also gain practical, hands-on knowledge of certain digital technologies and methods.

Digital History is not a normal fields-course that prepares students for historiographical knowledge. Rather, it balances historiography with technical and computational training. The merger of historiography and computational techniques are showcased by your individual projects.

DH is a large field. This year, the course will be focusing on data, data analysis, and data visualizations. We will also be using GitHub as a central hub to which we will push our work and from which we will pull to a personal website.

This course is a 4-credit course, which means that in addition to the scheduled meeting times, students are expected to do at least 9.5 hours of course-related work outside of class each week during the semester. This includes time spent completing assigned readings, participating in discussion sessions, studying for tests and examinations, preparing written assignments, and other course-related tasks.

## Goals

- Gain knowledge of computational processes in acquiring, transforming, analyzing, and visualizing data
- Begin to build specialization in one area of Digital History
- Develop a basic professional website that includes content (or links to content) to sketch out a DH portfolio
- Situate your work&mdash;and the field of DH&mdash;within the broader historiographical field.

## Laptops and other Hardware

Digital History *requires the use of a laptop running any common operating system* (Windows, Mac, or Linux), which you must bring to all of our class meetings.

Our classroom (CW 109) is a "Learning Studio" that is equipped with six small tables, each with four to five chairs, and each with its own large monitor. Ideally, we will place three students at each table. Try to mix the groups from week to week.

The course also requires that each student is able to connect their computer to one of the six monitors which have standard HDMI cables. If your laptop is not equipped with a standard HDMI port, *you are required to come to class with the necessary adaptor to make this connection possible*.

## Key Dates

We will have 36 hours of in-class meeting time (12 meetings x 3hrs/meeting). You are expected to arrive on time and to be prepared to stay for the full duration of the class. Most weeks will be split evenly between discussion, tutorial, and individual work.

A full schedule of classes is offered in the last pages of the syllabus. Please take note of these **key dates:

- We meet in CW 109 from 6:30 - 9:30 pm on these dates:
  - 2024-01-22 - 2024-04-29 (inclusive with exceptions noted below)
  - 2024-04-25 (Thursday)

- We **do not** meet on these dates:
  - 2024-03-04 (March Break)
  - 2024-03-25 (Prof. is away)
  - 2024-04-01 (Easter)
  - 2024-04-22 (Passover)  

- You have assignments due on these dates:
  - 2024-03-15 proposal
  - 2024-05-15 personal website, final project

Beyond in-class meetings, students are expected to work **at least** 9.5 hours per week, including about 3.5 hours of reading (approx. 100 pages per week) and another 6 hours of technical/computational training.

## Grading

| value | item |
| --- | --- |
| 20% | Reading, discussion, and participation |
| 30% | exercises |
| 20% | personal website|
| 30% | term project |

### Reading, Discussion, and Participation (20%)

Students are expected to attend all sessions, to engage with course content, and to have completed the readings on Perusall, which will not be more than 100 pages per week.

### Exercises (10 x 3% -> 30%)

In each of our meetings, students will be asked to complete an exercise focusing upon one technology (platform, code, or application) that is important to many DH projects. The exercises are due by the end of the week in which they are introduced, i.e. by the end of Sunday. The form of submission will vary from week to week, depending upon the technology in focus. In some cases, you might finish in class, but mostly you'll need to finish at home.

| no. | exercise | date-introduced | date-due |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. | HTML & CSS & GitHub Pages | 2024-01-29 | 2024-02-04 |
| 2. | GitHub Version Control | 2024-02-06 | 2024-02-11 |
| 3. | OpenRefine | 2024-02-12 | 2024-02-18 |
| 4. | Voyant | 2024-02-19 | 2024-02-25 |
| 5. | Python Text Analysis | 2024-02-26 | 2024-03-10 |
| 6. | SQL & RDBMS | 2024-03-11 | 2024-03-17 |
| 7. | Tableau | 2024-03-18 | 2024-03-24 |
| 8. | Leaflet | 2024-04-08 | 2024-04-14 |
| 9. | R Mapping | 2024-04-15 | 2024-04-21 |
| 10. | Web Archiving | 2024-04-25 | 2024-04-28 |

Each of the exercises will use open source, non-proprietary applications or coding languages. Some downloads onto your laptop will be required.

Do not expect to master any of these. Rather, the hope is that you will continue to learn one or more of them in order to pursue an intermediate skill set that can be applied to your research paper and highlighted as part of a DH portfolio in your personal webpage. The [Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/) is a wonderful resource to advance skills within various coding languages or research categories.

## Personal GitHub Page (20%)

Students will build their own website that introduces themselves professionally as a Digital Historian (or Digital Humanist/Scholar in some other vein) and that acts as professional DH portfolio, providing examples of your own DH work as either hosted content or linked externally. This website will be composed in VS Code and pushed to GitHub as a GitHub Page. This will also be submitted by 11:50 pm on 2024-05-15.

## Term Project (total 30%)

The term paper project has three parts: a proposal; an in-class presentation; and a term paper. Each is outlined below.

The proposal for term project is due by 11:59 pm on 2024-03-15 and is worth 5%. It should be composed in Markdown and submitted via email. It will include a 300 - 500 word introduction and a short bibliography of relevant materials.

In-class presentations will be given to the class as 'lightning talks', i.e. 4-6 minute presentations with visuals, leaving time for Q & A. These presentations will be given on one of three dates: April 8, April 15, or April 25, with no more than four students scheduled on any given day.

The final paper is due two months after the proposal (i.e. by the end of the day on 2024-05-15) and is worth 25%. The final paper is a 15-20 page term paper that highlights one DH methodology and demonstrates a significant engagement with **one of** the following:

1. The use in historiography of a particular DH method or closely-related family of methods;
2. The technical and/or theoretical value of a particular DH method; or
3. The application of a particular DH method within your own historical research.

The choice of DH method is open but should be discussed with the professor in advance of the submission of the proposal. The essay will be composed within a Jupyter Notebook using Markdown and be pushed to your GitHub page. It should contain footnotes and a bibliography.

## ACADEMIC HONESTY

Don’t cheat, plagiarize, have somebody else do your work for you, or turn in work from another course. If you are caught, you will automatically fail the course, in addition to any university-mandated penalties for plagiarism and academic dishonesty.  Get familiar with [Binghamton’s Student Academic Honesty Code](https://www.binghamton.edu/bulletin/2023-24/policiesprocedures/index.html#p002). If you are confused about what might constitute academic dishonesty or plagiarism, please see your instructor.

### FURTHER NOTES ON ACADEMIC HONESTY

1. Don’t plagiarize – either directly, or by neglecting to cite ideas and arguments. Changing a few words or a verb tense, or rearranging a sentence, does not count as “putting something in your own words,” even if you’ve added a citation.
2. Don’t pay others to do your assignments for you – it’s often more obvious than you think, especially for a paper due at the end of the semester, when we have become somewhat familiar with your writing style and general work habits. Or you might not get your money’s worth and end up with a D.
3. Don’t turn in work from another course. If you find complementary themes or materials in your other classes that you wish to make use of, clear it with me first.
4. Students in this course are not permitted to submit any work that uses text generated from artificial intelligence.
