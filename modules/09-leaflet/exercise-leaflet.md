# Take Home Exercise

Complete the following steps and share the resulting html file with me either by email or with a link to the file within your github repository.

1. Create a new ArcGIS Online Feature Layer within your AGOL account. Ideally, this layer will be related to your project or research interests. Otherwise, create a feature layer that is related to your interests.
2. Create an html document with an appropriate header.
3. Add a paragraph of text introducing the map (created in step 4)
4. Add a "script" element inside the html document (following the M09 lesson as a template).
5. Write a script to create a leaflet map that includes an appropriate basemap along with the feature layer created above (as well as any other layers you wish show), and customized popups. Feel free to add other elements as desired, such as layer controls and clustering.
6. Test your webpage and map often, especially before submitting.
7. Share the resulting html file with me either by email or with a link to the file within your github repository
