THE WOLF, THE DOG AND THE COLLAR

A comfortably plump dog happened to run into a wolf. The wolf asked the dog where he had
been finding enough food to get so big and fat. 'It is a man,' said the dog, 'who gives me
all this food to eat.' The wolf then asked him, 'And what about that bare spot there on
your neck?' The dog replied, 'My skin has been rubbed bare by the iron collar which my
master forged and placed upon my neck.' The wolf then jeered at the dog and said, 'Keep
your luxury to yourself then! I don't want anything to do with it, if my neck will have to
chafe against a chain of iron!'
