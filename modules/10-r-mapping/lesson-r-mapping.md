# Mapping with Leaflet in R

## What is R?

[About R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html)

R is a statistical programming language that was built for statistical computing and data visualization. Although R was not originally designed to handle spatial data, today it can perform much of the analysis traditionally done by GIS software.

There are many pre-existing map making libraries in R, and more are being added all the time. R is popular and free, open-source software, which makes it a fairly accessible option for mapping projects. Finally, making maps using programming is a nice way to produce maps that are transparent and accessible; you can share your code with any collaborator, and they will be able to follow the work that you did step-by-step.

## R vs Python

There are two open-source programs that most data scientists use: R and Python. R is more specialized than Python and is really good at the tasks it was built for. Python is more versatile and is better suited to making applications.

## Install R

[Install R here](https://cran.r-project.org/)

- Select your operating system (for example, I use Windows)
- Windows users:
  - at the top of “R for —-”, click “install R for the first time”
  - Click “Download R-4.2.2 for Windows” (it might be a newer version now - that’s ok!) and follow the instructions on your screen once the file has downloaded
- Mac users:
  - click “download R of macOS”
  - Click “R-4.2.2.pkg” to download

## R-Studio

R-Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE). You will use R-Studio to install and manage packages; to compose markdown notebooks (.rdm); to run code; to export to html or other formats; and to publish your notebooks to R-Pubs.

## R Variables

In R, a variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it. To assign a value to a variable, use the `<-` sign. To output (or print) the variable value, just type the variable name.
