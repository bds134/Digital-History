# Take-Home Exercise R/Leaflet Mapping

Complete the following steps and share the resulting rmd and html files with the instructor either by email or with a link to the file within your github repository.

1. Create a new R Markdown file called "[your surname]-r-leaflet.rmd" (e.g. skopyk-r-leaflet.rmd)
2. Write an Leaflet map R script for that will be knit together as an html file. This R script should have the following characteristics:
   1. Each additional step should include appropriate comments and should be introduced with appropriate text and markdown headers.
   2. The script should read-in a shapefile from your own ArcGIS Online data source. You can (but do not need to) use the same data source that you used for your take-home exercise submission in M09.
   3. Add a basemap.
   4. The leaflet layer should have customized and appropriate popups.
   5. If you are using point data, add clustering.
   6. If you have varied symbology (i.e. polygons with variable shading and/or coloring, or points with differentiated markers), add a legend.
   7. If you have more than one layer, add layer controls.
3. As stated above, submit by email with attachments or a link to the git repo.
